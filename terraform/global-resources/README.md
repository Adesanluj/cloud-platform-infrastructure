# global-resources

These are resources that are global in nature and therefore there are no workspaces in this terraform state.

**NOTE**

Since resources in multiple accounts are used here, multiple AWS providers are defined.
You can see the list of providers in [main.tf](main.tf#L10-29), as well as the names of the AWS profiles that must be configured for this to run properly.
